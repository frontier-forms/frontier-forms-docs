# What is Frontier


Most React form libraries brings you good state and error management.

Frontier goes beyond that in providing a brand new form development experience.

## Full data lifecycle management

By just providing a [GraphQL mutation](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations) and an [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/), Frontier will:

- Infer which fields are required for validation
- Handle the State and error management with a [familiar API](/api/frontier-component)
- Save the data

## UI-Kit

Frontier is the only form library that help you to bring a consistent experience to your users without efforts.

[Frontier UI-kit API](/api/frontier-ui-kit) allows you to define the components that will define the look and feel of all the forms of your application.


Once your UI-kit defined, you will be able to build your form using either:

- the full rendering feature
- render props

See ["Frontier UI-Kit"](/frontier-ui-kit), for a starting guide with UI-Kit.
