## API - overview

The API of `Frontier forms`, for all flavours, is divided in 3 parts:

- **Data description**: how to describe your data, with `GraphQL`.
- **[Form state](/api/form-state/)**: how to get access to the state of your form
- **[Form modifiers](/api/form-modifiers)**: how to update your Form state.

----

*Note:* The API design was [built from `<ApolloForm>`](https://github.com/wittydeveloper/react-apollo-form) and [inspired by Angular `FormControl`](https://angular.io/api/forms/FormControl)
in order to provide all features needed to build great forms.
