## Under the hood

`Frontier forms`'s magic is not complex dark magic.

This page will explain you how `Frontier forms` is working under the hood

----

```
import gql from 'graphql-tag';
import { Frontier } from 'frontier-forms';

const mutation = gql`
    mutation update_user(user: UserInputType!) {
        ...User
    }
`;

const constraints = gql`
  type UserInputTypeConstraints {
    username: String! @constraint(minLength: 5, format: "email")
  }
`

<Frontier mutation={mutation} constraints={constraints} />
```

### How does this work?

1. `Frontier forms` do call (in dev mode) the GQL API for introspection and get schema
2. `Frontier forms` extract mutation name from `mutation=`
3. if `constraints=` is given, we merge all types used in mutation with their `<type>Constraints` type equivalent

#### Why do we have to provide `constraints=` attribute?
This solution is nice, easy to implement and we will we be able to drop the `constraints=` thing when GraphQL specs will evolve (including directives in introspection).
